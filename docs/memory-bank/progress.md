- ✅ **Tie-Breaking**: Uses SubmissionId for consistent tie-breaking within groups

### **CORE ARCHITECTURE** ✅

#### **Unified Backend Architecture**

```csharp
// UNIFIED APPROACH: Auto-generate SubmissionVotes for Round 1 judgments
if (request.VotingRound == 1)
{
    bool votesGenerated = await ConvertJudgmentsToVotesIfCompleteAsync(
        request.CompetitionId,
        request.JudgeId,
        round1Assignment.AssignedGroupNumber,
        cancellationToken);
}
```

## MVP User Feedback Collection Plan

To ensure the MVP meets user needs and to gather insights for future iterations, the following feedback mechanisms will be implemented:

1.  **In-App Feedback Widget (Optional):**
    * A simple, non-intrusive feedback widget (e.g., "Got Feedback?") available on most pages, allowing users to submit quick comments, bug reports, or suggestions.
2.  **Post-Core Action Surveys:**
    * Short, targeted surveys presented to users after completing key actions for the first time:
        * After successful registration.
        * After submitting to a competition.
        * After making a purchase.
    * Focus on ease of use, clarity, and overall satisfaction with that specific flow. (e.g., using a 1-5 scale and an open comment box).
3.  **Targeted User Interviews (Post-MVP Launch Beta Group):**
    * Recruit a small group of 5-10 initial beta users representing the target audience.
    * Conduct semi-structured interviews (30-45 minutes) after they have had a chance to use the MVP features for 1-2 weeks.
    * Focus on understanding their overall experience, pain points, unmet needs, and most/least valuable features.
4.  **Basic Analytics Tracking:**
    * Implement analytics (e.g., using a simple setup with AWS Pinpoint or a GDPR-compliant alternative) to track:
        * User registration flow completion rates.
        * Competition submission funnel.
        * E-commerce purchase funnel.
        * Adoption rates of key features.
        * Common drop-off points in user journeys.
5.  **Support Email/Channel:**
    * A clearly indicated support email address or channel for users to report issues or ask questions.

Feedback will be regularly reviewed by the product team to identify trends, prioritize bug fixes, and inform the backlog for Phase 2.

## Initial Architect Prompt

Based on the MixWarz Application Development Plan and MVP scope, the following technical guidance is provided:

### Technical Infrastructure

-   **Starter Project/Template:** While no specific starter template is mandated, the backend API must adhere to **Clean Architecture** principles.
-   **Hosting/Cloud Provider:** **AWS** is the designated cloud platform.
-   **Frontend Platform:**
    * **React (latest version)** is the chosen library.
    * Utilize **Material-UI (MUI)** for UI components.
    * Employ **React Query** for server-state management and data fetching.
    * Use **Axios** for HTTP communication.
    * Implement client-side routing with **React Router**.
-   **Backend Platform:**
    * **.NET Core Web API (latest LTS version)**.
    * Utilize **Entity Framework Core (latest LTS version)** as the ORM.
-   **Database Requirements:**
    * Primary RDBMS: **PostgreSQL** is preferred due to open-source nature and cost-effectiveness (SQL Server is an alternative if strong team preference exists). To be hosted on **AWS RDS**.
    * Caching/Real-time Data: **Redis** (e.g., for leaderboards, session management). To be hosted on **AWS ElastiCache**.

### Technical Constraints

-   The system must expose **RESTful APIs** for frontend-backend communication.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** shall be used for user authentication.
-   A **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system is required, initially supporting 'Admin', 'User', and 'Organizer' roles. Resource-based authorization considerations for Organizers managing their own competitions should be planned.
-   All communication must be over **HTTPS**.
-   The application (backend API) must be **containerized using Docker**.
-   The initial e-commerce module will focus on **digital goods**.
-   **Input validation** (client-side and server-side) is critical.
-   The system should be designed for **stateless API services** to facilitate horizontal scaling.

### Deployment Considerations

-   A **CI/CD pipeline** must be established (e.g., using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy).
-   The backend API (Docker containers) should be deployed to **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)**, with **AWS Fargate** recommended as the launch type for the MVP to simplify infrastructure management.
-   Frontend static assets (React build) are to be hosted on **AWS S3** and served via **AWS CloudFront (CDN)**.
-   Distinct **development, staging, and production environments** are necessary.
-   Docker images are to be stored in **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**.

### Local Development & Testing Requirements

-   A **`docker-compose.yml`** setup is required to enable local development, allowing developers to run the API, database (PostgreSQL/SQL Server container), and Redis container locally.
-   The system must support:
    * **Unit testing:** (e.g., xUnit/NUnit for .NET, Jest/React Testing Library for React).
    * **Integration testing:** (e.g., testing API endpoints with a test database).
    * **End-to-end (E2E) testing:** for critical user flows (e.g., using Cypress or Playwright).
-   The CI/CD pipeline should automate the execution of these tests.

### Other Technical Considerations

-   **Security:** Adhere to OWASP Top 10 recommendations. Implement secure password hashing (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt). Securely manage secrets (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager). Perform virus scanning for file uploads.
-   **Scalability:** Design for horizontal scaling of the API. Implement efficient database querying and indexing. Utilize caching with Redis effectively.
-   **Logging:** Implement structured logging (e.g., using Serilog or NLog for .NET Core) and integrate with AWS CloudWatch Logs.
-   **Error Handling:** Implement robust global error handling middleware in the API to provide standardized error responses.
-   **File Storage:** User-uploaded audio files and digital products should be stored in AWS S3.
-   **Clean Architecture:** The backend API must strictly follow Clean Architecture principles (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation layers).
-   **EF Core Migrations:** Use EF Core migrations for database schema management (Code-First approach).

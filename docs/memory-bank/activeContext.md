# Active Context

## Current Focus

**UNIFIED APPROACH FOR VOTING/JUDGMENT TALLYING - COMPLETED** ✅

**User Request**: Implement unified approach to eliminate code duplication between voting and judgment systems. Use "Tally Votes & Advance" as the single tallying method. Follow SOLID principles and avoid unnecessary code.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED - JUDGMENT-TO-VOTE CONVERSION SYSTEM**:

### **Business Logic Requirement Met** ✅

**User's Preferred Workflow**:

1. **Judging Interface** → Users score submissions with detailed criteria
2. **Automatic Conversion** → Judgment scores automatically converted to 1st/2nd/3rd place votes
3. **Traditional Tallying** → Single "Tally Votes & Advance" system used
4. **Ranking Logic** → Winner determined by most 1st place rankings
5. **Tie-Breaking** → Judgment scores preserved for additional tie-breaking

### **SOLID Principles Implementation** ✅

**Single Responsibility Principle**:

- ✅ `ConvertJudgmentsToVotesIfCompleteAsync()` - Dedicated method for judgment-to-vote conversion
- ✅ `TallyVotesAndDetermineAdvancementAsync()` - Single responsibility for tallying and advancement
- ✅ Existing services maintain their original responsibilities

**Open/Closed Principle**:

- ✅ Enhanced `SubmitJudgmentCommandHandler` by extending functionality without modifying core logic
- ✅ Extended `TallyVotesAndDetermineAdvancementAsync()` to handle auto-generated votes without changing algorithm

**Liskov Substitution Principle**:

- ✅ Auto-generated `SubmissionVotes` work identically to traditional votes in tallying system
- ✅ No behavioral changes to existing vote processing logic

**Interface Segregation Principle**:

- ✅ Removed unused `TallyJudgmentsAndDetermineAdvancementAsync()` method from interface
- ✅ Clean interface with only necessary methods

**Dependency Inversion Principle**:

- ✅ Services depend on `IAppDbContext` abstraction, not concrete implementations
- ✅ Maintained existing dependency injection patterns

### **DRY Principle Implementation** ✅

**Code Duplication Eliminated**:

- ✅ **REMOVED**: 117 lines of duplicate tallying logic in `TallyJudgmentsAndDetermineAdvancementAsync()`
- ✅ **REMOVED**: Parallel controller endpoint `/api/competitions/{id}/round1/tally-judgments`
- ✅ **REMOVED**: Duplicate interface method signature
- ✅ **REMOVED**: Redundant frontend `handleTallyJudgments()` function and dual button UI

**Unified Implementation**:

- ✅ Single tallying method handles both traditional votes AND auto-generated votes from judgments
- ✅ Same ranking algorithm, tie-breaking logic, and advancement rules for all votes
- ✅ Same business validation and authorization patterns

### **Technical Implementation Details** ✅

**Core Enhancement - SubmitJudgmentCommandHandler**:

```csharp
// UNIFIED APPROACH: Auto-generate SubmissionVotes for Round 1 judgments
bool votesGenerated = false;
if (request.VotingRound == 1)
{
    // Check if judge has completed all judgments for their assigned group
    votesGenerated = await ConvertJudgmentsToVotesIfCompleteAsync(
        request.CompetitionId,
        request.JudgeId,
        round1Assignment.AssignedGroupNumber,
        cancellationToken);
}
```

**Smart Conversion Logic**:

```csharp
// BUSINESS LOGIC: Convert judgment scores to traditional rankings (1st=3pts, 2nd=2pts, 3rd=1pt)
// Rank submissions by OverallScore (highest first)
var rankedJudgments = judgeCompletedJudgments
    .OrderByDescending(sj => sj.OverallScore)
    .ThenBy(sj => sj.SubmissionId) // Consistent tie-breaking
    .ToList();

// Create SubmissionVotes based on judgment rankings
for (int i = 0; i < Math.Min(3, rankedJudgments.Count); i++) // Top 3 get votes
{
    var rank = i + 1;
    var points = 4 - rank; // 1st=3pts, 2nd=2pts, 3rd=1pt
    // ... create SubmissionVote
}
```

**Enhanced Tallying System**:

- ✅ `TallyVotesAndDetermineAdvancementAsync()` now processes both traditional votes AND auto-generated votes
- ✅ Comments added explaining unified approach: _"UNIFIED APPROACH: This method now tallies both traditional votes AND auto-generated votes from judgments"_
- ✅ User's preferred ranking logic: _"Most 1st place rankings wins"_

### **Frontend Simplification** ✅

**UI Streamlined**:

- ✅ **Single Button**: "Tally Votes & Advance" (removed dual button complexity)
- ✅ **Updated Tooltips**: "UNIFIED APPROACH: Tally Votes & Advance to Round 2"
- ✅ **Simplified Help Text**: "UNIFIED SYSTEM: Automatically processes both traditional rankings and judgment-based scores"
- ✅ **Removed Function**: `handleTallyJudgments()` eliminated (49 lines removed)

**User Experience**:

- ✅ Admin sees single, clear action: "Tally Votes & Advance"
- ✅ System automatically handles sophisticated judgment scoring behind the scenes
- ✅ No confusion about which tallying method to use

### **Architecture Benefits** ✅

**No Unnecessary Code**:

- ✅ Zero duplicate business logic - single tallying system for all scenarios
- ✅ Minimal implementation focusing on essential integration only
- ✅ Reused 100% of existing advancement framework
- ✅ No new database tables, entities, or complex abstractions needed

**Future-Proof Design**:

**PREVIOUS CONTEXT - TALLY VOTES 400 ERROR - COMPLETED** ✅

**Issue Resolved**: 400 error when attempting to "Tally Votes & Advance to Round 2" from admin interface.

**Root Cause**: Workflow gap - admin interface called tally endpoint while competition in `VotingRound1Open` status, but backend required `VotingRound1Tallying` status.

**Solution**: Enhanced `handleTallyVotes` function with automatic status transition from `VotingRound1Open` → `VotingRound1Tallying` before tallying.

**Result**: Seamless admin experience with no manual intervention required.

---

**JUDGING COMPLETION INDICATOR - COMPLETED** ✅

**User Request**: After user completes judging, show completion status and remove "Start Judging" button.

**Solution**: Dynamic UI rendering based on `hasVotedRound1` state from backend `Round1Assignment.HasVoted` property.

**Result**:

- ✅ Before: "🎯 Judge Submissions" with "Start Judging" button
- ✅ After: "✅ Judging Complete" with thank you message

---

**USER PROFILE TABS SIMPLIFICATION - COMPLETED** ✅

**User Request**: Remove Competitions, Gallery, and Audio Portfolio tabs (may be added back future).

**Solution**: Commented out tabs with "FUTURE:" markers for easy restoration.

**Result**: Clean profile interface with Submissions, Activity Stats, and Activity History tabs.

---

**PROFILE PICTURE STORAGE LOCATION - COMPLETED** ✅

**User Request**: Fix storage from `\wwwroot\uploads\profile-pictures` to `\AppData\uploads\profile-pictures`.

**Solution**: Updated configuration in appsettings and fallback paths in services.

**Result**: Consistent file storage in `AppData/uploads` with proper static file serving.

**405 ERROR INVESTIGATION - RESOLVED** ✅

**User Issue**: Admin receiving 405 "Method Not Allowed" error when attempting to use "Tally Votes & Advance" process.

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**:

### **The Problem** 🔍

- **Error**: `GET https://localhost:7001/api/v1/admin/competitions/21 405 (Method Not Allowed)`
- **Issue**: Frontend was calling a **non-existent endpoint** to get competition status before tallying
- **Wrong Call**: `/api/v1/admin/competitions/{id}` (doesn't exist in AdminController)
- **Correct Endpoint**: Should call `Round1AssignmentController.TallyVotes` directly

### **The Solution** ✅

**REFACTORED FRONTEND APPROACH**:

- ✅ **Removed Incorrect API Call**: Eliminated the non-existent admin competition endpoint call
- ✅ **Direct Endpoint Usage**: Frontend now calls the correct `POST /api/competitions/{id}/round1/tally-votes`
- ✅ **Enhanced Backend Logic**: Added auto-transition from `VotingRound1Open` → `VotingRound1Tallying` in backend
- ✅ **Better Error Messages**: Added specific error handling for 400, 404, and 405 status codes

**BACKEND ENHANCEMENTS**:

```csharp
// ENHANCED: Auto-transition from VotingRound1Open to VotingRound1Tallying if needed
if (competition.Status == CompetitionStatus.VotingRound1Open)
{
    _logger.LogInformation($"Auto-transitioning competition {competitionId} from VotingRound1Open to VotingRound1Tallying");
    competition.Status = CompetitionStatus.VotingRound1Tallying;
    await _competitionRepository.UpdateAsync(competition);
}
```

**FRONTEND SIMPLIFICATION**:

```javascript
// FIXED: Direct call to correct Round1AssignmentController endpoint
// The backend endpoint already handles status validation and auto-transition
const response = await axios.post(
  `https://localhost:7001/api/competitions/${competitionId}/round1/tally-votes`,
  {},
  { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } }
);
```

### **Build Status** ✅

- **Frontend**: ✅ Builds successfully (only ESLint warnings, no compilation errors)
- **Backend**: ✅ Code compiles correctly (only file locking warnings from running API)

### **Resolution Summary** ✅

1. **Identified Issue**: Frontend calling wrong endpoint for competition status check
2. **Fixed Routing**: Removed unnecessary admin endpoint call, using correct Round1AssignmentController
3. **Enhanced Backend**: Added automatic status transition in the service layer
4. **Improved UX**: Better error messages for debugging
5. **Code Quality**: No compilation errors, follows SOLID principles

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Admin should restart API and test the "Tally Votes & Advance" functionality

**Next Step**: User should restart the API to load the new code, then test the tally functionality

---

**ROUND 2 VOTING STATUS TRANSITION - RESOLVED** ✅

**User Issue**: Admin receiving "Failed to update competition: No response from server" error when attempting to change competition status from "Voting Round 2 Setup" to "Voting Round 2 Open".

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**:

### **The Problem** 🔍

- **Wrong Endpoint**: Frontend `handleUpdateStatus` function was calling generic admin status endpoint `/api/v1/admin/competitions/{id}/status`
- **Correct Endpoint**: Should call Round2VotingController setup endpoint `/api/competitions/{id}/round2/setup`
- **Business Logic Issue**: Round 2 transitions require specialized setup logic, not just status updates

### **The Solution** ✅

**ENHANCED FRONTEND ROUTING**:

- ✅ **Smart Status Detection**: `handleUpdateStatus` function now detects when `newStatus === "VotingRound2Open"`
- ✅ **Correct Endpoint Call**: Automatically routes to `POST /api/competitions/{competitionId}/round2/setup`
- ✅ **Unified Approach**: Avoids code duplication by enhancing existing function rather than creating new one
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages for Round 2 specific issues

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**:

```javascript
// ENHANCED: Check for Round 2 Setup to Open transition
if (newStatus === "VotingRound2Open") {
  // UNIFIED APPROACH: Call Round2VotingController setup endpoint for Round 2 transitions
  console.log(
    `🔄 Round 2 transition detected - calling Round2VotingController setup endpoint`
  );

  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  const response = await axios.post(
    `https://localhost:7001/api/competitions/${competitionId}/round2/setup`,
    {},
    {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    }
  );

  if (response.data.success) {
    // Handle success with proper UI feedback
  }
} else {
  // Use existing Redux action for other status transitions
  const result = await dispatch(
    updateCompetitionStatus({ competitionId, status: newStatus })
  );
}
```

**KEY BENEFITS**:

- ✅ **Zero Code Duplication**: Enhanced existing function instead of creating parallel systems
- ✅ **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility - one function handles all status transitions with smart routing
- ✅ **Better UX**: Enhanced error messages specifically for Round 2 transitions (400, 404, 405 status codes)
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Pattern can be extended for other specialized status transitions

### **Backend Endpoint Confirmation** ✅

**Round2VotingController.cs**:

- ✅ Route: `[Route("api/competitions/{competitionId}/round2")]`
- ✅ Method: `[HttpPost("setup")]` → `/api/competitions/{competitionId}/round2/setup`
- ✅ Authorization: `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Organizer")]`
- ✅ Status Validation: Checks `competition.Status != CompetitionStatus.VotingRound2Setup`
- ✅ Business Logic: Calls `_round2VotingService.SetupRound2VotingAsync(competitionId)`

### **Build Status** ✅

**Frontend**: ✅ Builds successfully (344.01 kB, +259 B increase - minimal impact)

- Only ESLint warnings (no compilation errors)
- Bundle size increase due to enhanced error handling logic

**System Integration**: ✅ Ready for testing

- Admin can now properly transition competitions from "Voting Round 2 Setup" to "Voting Round 2 Open"
- Correct endpoint will be called with proper authorization and business logic

### **Testing Scenarios** ✅

**Next Steps for User**:

1. Restart API to ensure latest backend code is loaded
2. Test Round 2 status transition: "Voting Round 2 Setup" → "Voting Round 2 Open"
3. Verify other status transitions still work correctly (using original admin endpoint)
4. Check console logs for proper endpoint routing confirmation

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Round 2 transitions: Calls `/api/competitions/{id}/round2/setup`
- ✅ Other transitions: Calls `/api/v1/admin/competitions/{id}/status`
- ✅ Success message: "Round 2 voting setup completed. X submissions are available for voting."

   int secondPlaceVotes = votes.Count(v => v.Rank == 2);
   int thirdPlaceVotes = votes.Count(v => v.Rank == 3);  // NEW

   // FIXED: Update all vote counts
   submissionGroup.ThirdPlaceVotes = thirdPlaceVotes;  // NEW
   ```

4. **Improved Ranking Algorithm**:

   ```csharp
   // ENHANCED: Complete tie-breaking hierarchy
   var rankedSubmissions = validSubmissions
       .OrderByDescending(sg => sg.TotalPoints)           // Primary: Total points
       .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.FirstPlaceVotes)        // Tie-break 1: Most 1st place
       .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.SecondPlaceVotes)       // Tie-break 2: Most 2nd place
       .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.ThirdPlaceVotes)        // Tie-break 3: Most 3rd place (NEW)
       .ToList();
   ```

{
    var votes = await _submissionVoteRepository.GetBySubmissionIdAsync(
        submissionGroup.SubmissionId, 1, 1, 1000);

    // Calculate all vote metrics
    int totalPoints = votes.Sum(v => v.Points);           // 1st=3pts, 2nd=2pts, 3rd=1pt
    int firstPlaceVotes = votes.Count(v => v.Rank == 1);  // Count of 1st place rankings
    int secondPlaceVotes = votes.Count(v => v.Rank == 2); // Count of 2nd place rankings
    int thirdPlaceVotes = votes.Count(v => v.Rank == 3);  // Count of 3rd place rankings (FIXED)

    // Update complete vote tallies

    await _submissionGroupRepository.UpdateAsync(submissionGroup);
}
```

**Enhanced Advancement Logic**:

```csharp
// FIXED: Complete ranking with all vote types
var rankedSubmissions = validSubmissions
    .OrderByDescending(sg => sg.TotalPoints)              // Most points wins
    .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.FirstPlaceVotes)           // Most 1st place votes
    .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.SecondPlaceVotes)          // Most 2nd place votes
    .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.ThirdPlaceVotes)           // Most 3rd place votes (FIXED)
    .ToList();

// Top 2 submissions in each group advance to Round 2
var advancingSubmissions = rankedSubmissions
    .Where((sg, index) => index < 2 ||
          // Special case: if tied for 2nd place, both advance
          (index == 2 &&
           sg.TotalPoints == rankedSubmissions[1].TotalPoints &&
           sg.FirstPlaceVotes == rankedSubmissions[1].FirstPlaceVotes &&
           sg.SecondPlaceVotes == rankedSubmissions[1].SecondPlaceVotes &&
           sg.ThirdPlaceVotes == rankedSubmissions[1].ThirdPlaceVotes))  // FIXED: Complete tie check

**JUDGMENT-BASED TALLYING IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETED** ✅

**User Request**: Update the TallyVotesAndDetermineAdvancementAsync process to properly use SubmissionJudgments table data. Sum the OverallScore from Round 1 judgments for each submission to calculate TotalPoints in SubmissionGroups table, and determine 1st/2nd/3rd place vote counts based on judge rankings.

**ENHANCED TALLYING LOGIC IMPLEMENTED**:

### **Business Logic Requirements Met** ✅

**User's Specific Requirements**:

1. ✅ **Sum OverallScore**: Sum SubmissionJudgments.OverallScore for each voter's judgment for Round 1
2. ✅ **Update TotalPoints**: Enter summed scores into SubmissionGroups.TotalPoints for each submission
3. ✅ **Calculate Vote Counts**: Determine 1st, 2nd, 3rd place votes from judgment rankings per judge
4. ✅ **Integration**: All processing happens during TallyVotesAndDetermineAdvancementAsync method

### **Technical Implementation Details** ✅

**Enhanced TallyVotesAndDetermineAdvancementAsync Method**:

```csharp
// UPDATED APPROACH: Calculate TotalPoints from SubmissionJudgments OverallScore and determine rankings
// This processes judgment data to calculate scores and vote counts

// Step 1: Calculate TotalPoints from SubmissionJudgments
foreach (var submissionGroup in submissionGroups)
{
    // Reset vote counts before recalculating
    submissionGroup.FirstPlaceVotes = 0;
    submissionGroup.SecondPlaceVotes = 0;
    submissionGroup.ThirdPlaceVotes = 0;

    // Get all completed judgments for this submission in Round 1
    var judgments = await _context.SubmissionJudgments
        .Where(sj => sj.SubmissionId == submissionGroup.SubmissionId &&
                   sj.CompetitionId == competitionId &&
                   sj.VotingRound == 1 &&
                   sj.IsCompleted == true &&
                   sj.OverallScore.HasValue)
        .ToListAsync();

    // Calculate total points by summing OverallScore from all judgments
    decimal totalPoints = judgments.Sum(j => j.OverallScore.Value);

    // Update submission group with tallied scores
    submissionGroup.TotalPoints = (int)Math.Round(totalPoints);
}
```

**Vote Count Calculation Logic**:

```csharp
// Step 2: Calculate 1st/2nd/3rd place votes based on each judge's rankings
foreach (var assignment in groupAssignments)
{
    // Get judgments from this specific judge, ranked by their OverallScore
    var judgeJudgments = await _context.SubmissionJudgments
        .Where(sj => sj.JudgeId == assignment.VoterId &&
                   sj.CompetitionId == competitionId &&
                   sj.VotingRound == 1 &&
                   sj.IsCompleted == true &&
                   sj.OverallScore.HasValue)
        .OrderByDescending(sj => sj.OverallScore)  // Rank by judge's scores
        .ThenBy(sj => sj.SubmissionId)  // Consistent tie-breaking
        .ToListAsync();

    // Assign 1st, 2nd, 3rd place votes based on judge's rankings
    for (int rank = 0; rank < Math.Min(3, judgeJudgments.Count); rank++)
    {
        var judgment = judgeJudgments[rank];
        var submissionGroup = submissionGroups.First(sg => sg.SubmissionId == judgment.SubmissionId);

        // Increment vote counts based on ranking
        switch (rank)
        {
            case 0: // 1st place (highest OverallScore from this judge)
                submissionGroup.FirstPlaceVotes = (submissionGroup.FirstPlaceVotes ?? 0) + 1;
                break;
            case 1: // 2nd place
                submissionGroup.SecondPlaceVotes = (submissionGroup.SecondPlaceVotes ?? 0) + 1;
                break;
            case 2: // 3rd place
                submissionGroup.ThirdPlaceVotes = (submissionGroup.ThirdPlaceVotes ?? 0) + 1;
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

**Final Ranking and Advancement Logic**:

```csharp
// Step 3: Final ranking using complete criteria
var rankedSubmissions = validSubmissions
    .OrderByDescending(sg => sg.TotalPoints)                    // Primary: Sum of all OverallScores
    .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.FirstPlaceVotes ?? 0)           // Tie-break 1: Most 1st place rankings
    .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.SecondPlaceVotes ?? 0)          // Tie-break 2: Most 2nd place rankings
    .ThenByDescending(sg => sg.ThirdPlaceVotes ?? 0)           // Tie-break 3: Most 3rd place rankings
    .ToList();

// Mark top 2 submissions per group as advancing to Round 2
foreach (var sg in advancingSubmissions)
{
    submission.AdvancedToRound2 = true;
    submission.IsEligibleForRound2Voting = true;
    submission.Round1Score = sg.TotalPoints;  // Sum of all judge OverallScores
}

### **Data Flow Process** ✅

**Judgment to Score Conversion**:

1. **Data Source**: `SubmissionJudgments` table with `OverallScore` from Round 1 judgments
2. **TotalPoints Calculation**: Sum all `OverallScore` values for each submission
3. **Ranking per Judge**: Order submissions by each judge's `OverallScore` (highest to lowest)
4. **Vote Count Assignment**:
   - Judge's highest scored submission = +1 FirstPlaceVotes
   - Judge's 2nd highest scored submission = +1 SecondPlaceVotes
   - Judge's 3rd highest scored submission = +1 ThirdPlaceVotes
5. **Final Ranking**: Primary by TotalPoints, then by vote counts for tie-breaking
6. **Advancement**: Top 2 submissions per group advance to Round 2

### **Database Integration** ✅

**Tables Updated**:

- ✅ **SubmissionGroups.TotalPoints**: Sum of OverallScore from all judgments
- ✅ **SubmissionGroups.FirstPlaceVotes**: Count of 1st place rankings per judge
- ✅ **SubmissionGroups.SecondPlaceVotes**: Count of 2nd place rankings per judge
- ✅ **SubmissionGroups.ThirdPlaceVotes**: Count of 3rd place rankings per judge
- ✅ **Submissions.AdvancedToRound2**: Boolean flag for Round 2 eligibility
- ✅ **Submissions.Round1Score**: Final TotalPoints score for reference

**Query Optimization**:

- ✅ Efficient filtering: `CompetitionId`, `VotingRound = 1`, `IsCompleted = true`
- ✅ Null safety: `OverallScore.HasValue` check before processing
- ✅ Consistent ordering: `OverallScore DESC, SubmissionId ASC` for tie-breaking

### **Enhanced Logging and Debugging** ✅

**Detailed Logging Added**:

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation($"Submission {submissionGroup.SubmissionId}: TotalPoints = {submissionGroup.TotalPoints} (from {judgments.Count} judgments)");

_logger.LogInformation($"Group {groupNumber} Rank {i + 1}: Submission {sg.SubmissionId} " +
    $"(Points: {sg.TotalPoints}, 1st: {sg.FirstPlaceVotes}, 2nd: {sg.SecondPlaceVotes}, 3rd: {sg.ThirdPlaceVotes})");

_logger.LogInformation($"Submission {sg.SubmissionId} advanced to Round 2 with score {sg.TotalPoints}");

_logger.LogInformation($"Competition {competitionId} tallying complete. {advancedCount} submissions advanced to Round 2");
```

### **Business Logic Benefits** ✅

**Accurate Scoring System**:

- ✅ **Direct from Judgments**: Uses actual judge evaluations instead of intermediate vote conversions
- ✅ **Preserves Score Precision**: Maintains decimal precision from OverallScore until final rounding
- ✅ **Transparent Rankings**: Clear calculation from judgment data to final placement
- ✅ **Complete Vote Tracking**: All three vote types properly counted and used for tie-breaking

**Enhanced Competition Integrity**:

- ✅ **Judge-Based Rankings**: Each judge's preferences properly reflected in vote counts
- ✅ **Consistent Tie-Breaking**: Four-level hierarchy prevents arbitrary decisions
- ✅ **Data Traceability**: Clear path from SubmissionJudgment to final advancement
- ✅ **Reset and Recalculate**: Fresh calculation ensures data consistency

### **Files Modified** ✅

**Infrastructure Layer**:

- ✅ `src/MixWarz.Infrastructure/Services/Round1AssignmentService.cs` - Updated TallyVotesAndDetermineAdvancementAsync method

**Key Changes**:

1. **Data Source Change**: From `SubmissionVotes` to `SubmissionJudgments`
2. **TotalPoints Logic**: Sum `OverallScore` values instead of vote points
3. **Vote Count Logic**: Calculate from judge rankings instead of direct vote counting
4. **Reset Logic**: Clear existing vote counts before recalculation
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed tracking of calculation process

### **Testing Scenarios** ✅

**Ready for User Testing**:

1. **Run Competition with Judgments**: Complete judging process for Round 1
2. **Execute Tallying**: Use "Tally Votes & Advance" button in admin interface
3. **Verify TotalPoints**: Check SubmissionGroups table shows sum of OverallScores
4. **Verify Vote Counts**: Check 1st/2nd/3rd place votes match judge rankings
5. **Verify Advancement**: Top 2 submissions per group should advance to Round 2
6. **Check Round 2 Setup**: "No finalists available yet" message should be resolved

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ TotalPoints = Sum of all OverallScore values for each submission
- ✅ Vote counts reflect each judge's ranking preferences
- ✅ Final rankings use complete scoring hierarchy (TotalPoints → vote counts)
- ✅ Top submissions properly advance with correct scores
- ✅ Round 2 voting interface shows finalist submissions

**System State**: ✅ **READY FOR TESTING** - Enhanced tallying system now properly processes SubmissionJudgments data to calculate accurate TotalPoints and vote counts for Round 2 advancement.

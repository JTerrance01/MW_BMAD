# MixWarz Product Requirements Document (PRD) Updated - Added User Profile and Blog

## Intro

MixWarz is a novel web application designed to serve the music production and audio engineering community. This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of MixWarz. The MVP aims to launch a dynamic online platform with a dual focus: firstly, to host engaging mix competitions for audio engineers and music producers, and secondly, to provide a curated e-commerce marketplace for digital goods relevant to this demographic. Additionally, the MVP will include enhanced user profiles allowing users to showcase their work, and a blog section for community engagement and knowledge sharing. The MVP will validate the core concept and gather initial user feedback.

## Goals and Context

-   **Project Objectives:**
    * Launch a functional platform that allows users to participate in mixing competitions.
    * Enable users to purchase digital music production goods.
    * Provide users with enhanced profiles to showcase their visual identity and audio work.
    * Offer a blog platform for sharing and consuming articles related to music production and the audio industry.
    * Establish a foundational system for three core user roles: Admin, User, and Organizer (with Organizers initially being pre-approved or Admins creating competitions).
    * Validate the core value proposition of combining skill-based competition, specialized e-commerce, user content sharing, and informative articles.
    * Gather user feedback to inform future development phases.
-   **Problem Quantification & Market Impact:** *(To be supplied based on detailed market research and business analysis. This section will quantify the addressable market, user pain points, and the potential impact of MixWarz in monetary or engagement terms.)*
-   **Measurable Outcomes:**
    * Number of registered users.
    * Number of competition entries.
    * Number of products sold.
    * Number of profiles with uploaded media (profile picture, gallery images, audio files).
    * Number of blog articles published and viewed.
    * User engagement metrics (e.g., time on site, competition participation rate, profile completion rate, article readership, feature adoption rates).
    * User satisfaction scores (e.g., CSAT, NPS from feedback mechanisms).
-   **Success Criteria (for this version/MVP):**
    * Successful deployment of a stable platform capable of hosting at least one competition, processing e-commerce transactions, allowing users to customize their profiles with media, and displaying blog articles.
    * Demonstration of the technical feasibility and stability of the core architecture on AWS, including storage and retrieval of user-uploaded media and blog content.
    * Admins can successfully manage MVP-level competitions, the basic e-commerce catalog, and blog content.
    * Users can successfully register, customize their profiles with images and audio, submit to competitions, purchase digital products, and read blog articles through a clear and usable interface.
    * Positive qualitative feedback from initial beta users on core workflows, including profile customization and blog interaction.
-   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    * **User Acquisition & Activation:**
        * Number of new user registrations per week/month.
        * Percentage of registered users completing a core action (e.g., customizing profile, submitting to a competition, making a purchase, reading an article) within the first month.
    * **Competition Engagement:**
        * Number of competitions created and launched.
        * Average number of submissions per competition.
        * Competition completion rate.
    * **E-commerce Performance:**
        * Number of product sales per week/month.
        * Average order value (AOV).
        * Conversion rate.

        * Percentage of active users who have uploaded a profile picture.
        * Average number of gallery images and audio files uploaded per active user with a customized profile.
        * Profile page view counts.
    * **Blog Engagement:**
        * Number of articles published per month.
        * Average views per article.
        * Time spent on article pages.
        * (Optional) Social shares or comments per article.
    * **Platform Health & User Satisfaction:**
        * Site uptime and availability (target > 99.5% for MVP).
        * Key page load times (target < 3 seconds for critical pages, including profile pages with media).
        * User satisfaction score (target > 3.5/5 from initial feedback surveys).
        * Number of critical bugs reported post-launch (target < 5 critical bugs in the first month).
-   **Timeframe for MVP Goals:** *(To be defined by project stakeholders, typically aiming for achievement of initial KPI targets within 3-6 months post-launch to validate moving to Phase 2.)*

## Initial Architect Prompt

*(The initial architect prompt remains largely the same as the core technology choices are not changing, but the scope of features to be built upon this architecture has expanded.)*

Based on the MixWarz Application Development Plan and **updated MVP scope (including enhanced profiles and blog)**, the following technical guidance is provided:

### Technical Infrastructure

-   **Starter Project/Template:** Backend API must adhere to **Clean Architecture**.
-   **Hosting/Cloud Provider:** **AWS**.
-   **Frontend Platform:** **React (latest)**, **Material-UI (MUI)**, **React Query**, **Axios**, **React Router**.
-   **Backend Platform:** **.NET Core Web API (latest LTS)**, **Entity Framework Core (latest LTS)**.
-   **Database Requirements:** Primary: **PostgreSQL** (AWS RDS). Caching/Real-time: **Redis** (AWS ElastiCache).

### Technical Constraints

-   **RESTful APIs**.
-   **JWT** for authentication.
-   **RBAC** (Admin, User, Organizer). Resource-based considerations for Organizers, and potentially for user-owned profile content.
-   **HTTPS** for all communication.
-   Backend **containerized using Docker**.
-   E-commerce: **digital goods**. *User profile media (images, audio) and blog assets also need secure storage and delivery.*
-   **Input validation** is critical for all inputs, including file uploads (type, size, potential malware scanning).
-   **Stateless API services**.

### Deployment Considerations

-   **CI/CD pipeline** (AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy).
-   Backend API (Docker) to **AWS ECS (Fargate recommended)**.
-   Frontend static assets (React build) to **AWS S3** via **AWS CloudFront**.
-   Distinct **development, staging, production environments**.
-   Docker images in **AWS ECR**.

### Local Development & Testing Requirements

-   **`docker-compose.yml`** for local API, database, Redis.
-   Support **Unit, Integration, End-to-End testing**. CI/CD to automate tests.

### Other Technical Considerations

-   **Security:** OWASP Top 10. Secure password hashing. Secure secrets (AWS Secrets Manager). **Virus scanning for all file uploads (competition submissions, profile media, blog assets).**
-   **Scalability:** Horizontal API scaling. Efficient DB querying/indexing. Redis caching. S3 for scalable file storage.
-   **Logging:** Structured logging (Serilog) to AWS CloudWatch.
-   **Error Handling:** Global error handling middleware.
-   **File Storage:** User-uploaded audio files (competitions, profiles), images (profiles, blog), digital products in AWS S3, with appropriate access controls and organization.
-   **Clean Architecture:** Backend API must strictly follow.
-   **EF Core Migrations:** Code-First approach.
